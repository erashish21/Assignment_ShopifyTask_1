## Variable Declarations: -
You start by declaring variables to store references to HTML elements such as product prices, shipping charges, total cart amount, and a discount code input field.

## decreaseNumber Function:
This function is called when the user clicks to decrease the quantity of a product. It does the following:

It checks if the current quantity is not already at 0; otherwise, it shows an alert to prevent negative quantities.
If the quantity is greater than 0, it decreases the quantity by 1 and updates the item's price, the product total amount, and the total cart amount.

## increaseNumber Function:
This function is called when the user clicks to increase the quantity of a product. It does the following:

It checks if the current quantity is not already at the maximum value of 8; otherwise, it shows an alert to limit the quantity to a maximum of 8.
If the quantity is less than 8, it increases the quantity by 1 and updates the item's price, the product total amount, and the total cart amount.
discount_code Function: This function is called when the user attempts to apply a discount code. It does the following:

It checks if the entered discount code matches the code "ASHISH." If it does, it subtracts $20 from the total cart amount as a discount and displays
a success message. Otherwise, it displays an error message.
## Reasoning: 
Your code is written in JavaScript, which is commonly used for client-side interactions in web applications.
It's a suitable choice for handling user interactions like updating quantities and applying discounts.
You're also using plain HTML for the user interface elements.
